## Use
The mod will automatically regenerate your health and stamina passively over time. You can edit the
`config.json` file to customise the regeneration, including...

* Whether stamina regenerates (including how fast and when);
* Whether stamina _drains_ over time instead;
* Whether health regenerates (including how fast and when);
* Whether health _drains_ over time instead.

## Configure
A `config.json` will appear in the mod's folder after you run the game once. You can optionally
open the file in a text editor to configure the mod. If you make a mistake, just delete the file
and it'll be regenerated.
